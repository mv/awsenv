AWSenv
======

AWSenv - A puny little script to enable switching between different AWS API keys
for different accounts.


If you, like me, work with more than one Amazon AWS account this script will help
you by ajusting your environment variables, from one account to another.


Basically, think of RVM.... and you get the idea.


### Install

Copy _**awsenv.sh**_ anywhere in your PATH.

Add to your _**~/.bashrc**_

    export AWSENV_PROFILES_DIR="~/work/awsenv/profiles"
    source /path/to/awsenv.sh


Reopen your terminal, or login again to activate it.


As an extra, add to your PS1 variable:

    export PS1="\u@h:\w $(__awsenv_ps1)\n\$ "



### Setup

First you create a *__profiles__* dir which is a location to hold all your credentials.
For each Amazon account you create a second directory which holds at least 3 files:

    - aws-credential-file.cfg
    - cert-XXXXX.pem
    - pk-XXXXXXX.pem


Those files must be created by you. *__'aws-credential-file.cfg'__* must have the
following format:


    AWSAccessKeyId=<<your-access-key>>
    AWSSecretKey=<<your-secret-key>>


The *__pk/cert__* files are a self-signed X509 certificate generated by you. To
create such files take a look at [generating a X509 by yourself](https://gist.github.com/4177939).

You probably will need *__pk/cert__* only if you need to use EC2 AMI tools API. For
all other usages *__'aws-credential-file.cfg'__* will be sufficient.


When done, you will have something like this:


    /path/to/dir
      |
      +- profiles/
      |    +- account1/
      |    |    +- aws-credential-file.cfg
      |    |    +- cert-XXXXX.pem
      |    |    +- pk-XXXXXXX.pem
      |    |
      |    +- account2/
      |    |    +- aws-credential-file.cfg
      |    |    +- cert-YYYYY.pem
      |    |    +- pk-YYYYYYY.pem
      ...


### Using

    $ awsenv-ls                 # list all profiles.
    $ awsenv-set account1       # activate 'account1' as PROFILE_NAME, if it exists.



### PS1 prompt


Try and add to your prompt:

    export PS1="\u@h:\w $(__awsenv_ps1)\n\$ "



### How it works


The following variables are manipulated:


    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID           # aws: all API's
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY       # aws: all API's
    AWS_CREDENTIAL_FILE         # aws: for IAM.
    EC2_CERT                    # aws: for EC2 ami-tools
    EC2_PRIVATE_KEY             # aws: for EC2 ami-tools
    AWSENV_PROFILE              # mine: your current dir profile
